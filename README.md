# 🎧 Real-Time Three.js Audio Visualizer

An interactive, real-time audio visualizer built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) that syncs a glowing, wireframe orb to live audio frequencies. Audio playback drives dynamic shader animations and lighting effects, enhanced by bloom and color controls via an intuitive GUI panel.


## ✨ Features

- 🌀 **Glowing Wireframe Orb** – 3D orb geometry reacts in real time to audio frequencies.
- 🔊 **Real-Time Audio Analysis** – Captures and visualizes amplitude and frequency data.
- 🎨 **Interactive GUI Controls** – Customize color, bloom intensity, and visual parameters.
- ⚙️ **Shader-Driven Effects** – Built using GLSL shaders for dynamic surface animation.
- 💡 **Postprocessing Bloom** – Creates immersive glow using `postprocessing` effects.

## 🛠 Built With

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – 3D graphics rendering
- [postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing) – Visual effects like bloom
- [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) – Lightweight UI for tweaking visuals
- Web Audio API – Audio analysis and frequency data extraction
- GLSL – Custom vertex and fragment shaders
